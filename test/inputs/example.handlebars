Some {{ gettext "translated text"}} is matched.
But non-translated text is not matched.
Even with a {{ value }} embedded.
Or if it contains the word gettext or even the _ character.
You might also use a {{#gettext}}block helper{{/gettext}} like this.
As long as it is {{#helper}}named properly{{/helper}} of course.
And {{#helper}}nesting of {{#gettext}}helpers{{/gettext}} should be ok{{/helper}} too.
{{! comment strings }} are passed through
{{!-- including long-form {} comments with }} markup in them --}}
Things that {{dont}} {{ pattern match a gettext call}} are ignored.
And spurious { or }} or whatever markup doesn't confuse the parser.
Escaped quotes are ok, {{gettext 'so let\'s test'}} them.
Watch {{#helper}}out {{#foo}}{{#gettext}}for "quotes"{{/gettext}}{{/foo}}{{/helper}} too.
So, do we {{gettext good}}?
{{ formatMessage (gettext "{name} took {numPhotos, plural, =0 {no photos} =1 {one photo} other {# photos}}") name=firstname numPhotos=number }}
{{ formatMessage (gettext "adsasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdaadsfasdfadsfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfsdasasdasdasdasdadsdasdasdasd") name=firstname numPhotos=number }}
