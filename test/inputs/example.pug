  | Some #{ gettext("translated text") } is matched.

  | But non-translated text is not matched.
  | Even with a #{value} embedded.
  | Or if it contains the word gettext or even the _ character.

  Modern #{ _('pipeless multiline syntax') }

  and BTW #{ gettext("this is line 13") }

//- L10n: comments for translator would be cool

  // look out for those quotes

//- other types of comments are ignored
//- even if the look like L10n: or gettext('invocation')
p Have fun with #{ _('attributes') }
